In the area of supervised learning which deals much with classification. These are the
algorithms types:
• Linear Classifiers
 Logical Regression
 Naïve Bayes Classifier
 Perceptron
 Support Vector Machine
• Quadratic Classifiers
• K-Means Clustering
• Boosting
• Decision Tree
 Random Forest
• Neural networks
• Bayesian Networks
• K-Means Clustering
• Neural Network
• Self Organised Map
